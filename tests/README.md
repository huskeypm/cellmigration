This is where test cases go to create data for study 

square.yaml - imposes square (rectangle actually) potential to contain particles
cylinder.yaml - imposes cylinder potential to contain particles

expt.yaml - parameters needed to reproduce expt w/o ATP 
expt_watp.yaml - parameters needed to reproduce expt w ATP 


crowder_gradient.yaml - finite sized crowder with chemokine gradients in two directions
effrad.yaml - assumes crowders have an effective radius based on running a probability calculation 

states.yaml - instructions for simulating microglia states
